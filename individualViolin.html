<h1>Violin</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p class="words">
The violin is the most modern embodiment of stringed musical instruments played with a bow. 
Like the guitar and other plucked string instruments, bowed instruments date from antiquity. 
Although its precise origins are not completely understood, it is probable that the violin 
(and its larger siblings the viola and violoncello) evolved during the mid-16th century in Northern Italy. 
In addition to perhaps being the maker of the first true violins, Andrea Amati (ca. 1500-1577) was the patriarch of the Cremona school of violin making. 
During the next 150 years, other members of the Amati family and their followers, who included Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737) and Bartolomeo 
Giuseppe Guarneri (1698-1744), brought the violin to its highest level of perfection both as a musical instrument and as a work of art. 
During the 17th century, violin making spread to all of the other countries of Europe and, in the 18th and 19th centuries, to the rest of the world. 
Although violins have been and are being turned out in large numbers by factories in Europe and Asia, most fine violins are handmade by individual 
craftsmen using essentially the same methods employed by classical Italian makers several hundred years ago.

Several types of stringed musical instruments, among them the violin, the viola, and cello, 
cannot be successfully played without a bow, and are therefore referred to as "bowed stringed instruments." 
Because they are almost always heard while being bowed, the bow is considered an integral part of their tone production, 
contributing its own individual character and timbre. The use of different bows on the same instrument will produce correspondingly 
different tonality as a result. Most instrumentalists believe the bow's quality to be as important as the instrument's, and fine bows 
are therefore manufactured and selected with the utmost care.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<<p class="words">
The practice of using a bow of some sort to make musical sound is so ancient that its origin can only be surmised.
The most likely scenario is that the ancient hunting bow, its string treated with mixtures of wax and resin to hold the strands together, 
served as either instrument or bow in different contexts. From this primitive origin, the bow went through countless stages of evolution. 
The latest and most important to us today are the so-called "early" bow and the "modern" bow. All the bows of these types have important 
things in common: they are tapered sticks of special woods that are permanently bent to an arch, and have a flattened length of horsehair, 
stretched, under some tension, from end to end of the stick. One end is usually pointed, and the other squared off and usually fitted with a 
small raised portion to fasten and adjust the hair tension. The pointed end of each is called the "tip," and the raised portion of the other 
end, the "nut," or later, the "frog." (Experts are unclear as to how the latter name evolved.)<br><br>
The early bow (sometimes referred to as the "baroque" bow) is based on the oldest and most obvious of designs, 
and has a curve that bows away from the hair. This type of bow was in common use until some time in the early 19th century, 
when the modern bow came into use. Although their design made these bows agile and responsive, their delicacy was not suitable 
for the pressure needed for louder and more forceful playing. As the concert halls and orchestras became larger, the violin family 
instruments received subtle modifications to suit the demands of the great performers. No modification was possible for the early bow 
however, and it suffered a swift extinction at the hand of the modern bow. After the modern bow's inception, the early bow became&Amost 
unheard of until it was revived in the late 1960s by early music enthusiasts seeking to recreate the ambiance of that time period.
The modern bow was a revelation after its introduction in France around the turn of the 19th century. 
The Tourte family is generally given credit for giving the modern bow its accepted final form, much as Antonio Stradivari
 contributed to the making of the violin. Modern bow manufacture reached its pinnacle in Paris between the mid-19th to the 
 mid-20th centuries, and bowmakers came from all over Europe to collaborate with the famous French workshops and share their 
 excellent reputation for bowmaking. The biggest changes in the modern bow involved inverting the curve of the stick into the hair, 
 to give it more tension and resistance; shortening the tip to a squat hatchet-like shape to quicken the flex of the stick; introduction 
 of a screw and eye adjuster for finer adjustment of the hair; and the adoption of Pemarnbuco wood as the standard wood for the stick. Eventu
 al further improvements included adaptation of a ferrule on the frog to hold the hair spread the full width of the frog, at any tension. 
 The makers experimented with many subtle modifications, including building sticks with round or octagonal shafts, using precious metals and m
 aterials for the mountings, and incorporating subtle changes in the dimension and curvature of the stick. 
 Today, fine bows are made in much the same, if not exactly the same, manner as they once were by the craftsmen who designed them in 
 France over 150 years ago.</p>
